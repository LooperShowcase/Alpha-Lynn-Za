    <h4>Shape</h4>

    <p>
      Character shapes are extremely important to recognizing your favorite
      character, similar to how it's possible to recognize all of your favorite
      cartoon characters from your favorite television shows. Shape is an
      important asset to making your character recognizable within every image.

    <h4>Simplicity</h4>

    <p>
      Simplicty is another important asset to your character, and can make the
      visual appearance of a character more likeable to viewers. Especially
      within art, games, or TV shows! Don't overcomplicate every feature, remove
      an outline or two or make your character have a specific expression they
      like to show! Though it's important to not oversimplify a character, as it
      can cause the design to be plain and boring to viewers.

    <h4>Facial features</h4>

    <p>
      The facial features of a character are essential to creation. A
      character's face can reveal an entire personality to viewers about your
      character! Soft or more feminine features can reveal shyness, while more
      sharp features can reveal a serious persona within your character!
      Especially in games or art.

    <h4>Body Type</h4>

    <p>
      Height, structure and figure. A character's body is always important to
      development and personality! Some characters may have strong builds, with
      large muscles and tall figures. While other characters may be skinny,
      short, chubby, etc... Character's bodies can also be linked with a past,
      which gives viewers either an idea of what your character has gone
      through, or what they will develop into in the future of the show, art, or
      game your creating!

    <h4>Artstyles</h4>

    <p>
      Each character has a better appearance in different artstyles, and it's
      extremely important to experiment with your character in different styles
      to eventually create one that matches the character perfectly. For
      example, in a popular cartoon show "Steven Universe", every character is
      different with many shapes, facial features and different body types.
      Though not too different that you would be unable to conclude that those
      two characters are both from the same show. It's important to have
      different artstyles when drawing, though remember to always draw in the
      artstyle you prefer!

    <h4>Poses and Perspective</h4>

    <p>
      When drawing a character, three of the most important things to firstly do
      is: 1. Draw them in different Poses! 2. Experiment with style and
      perspective! 3. Plan ahead!
    </p>

    <p>
      Drawing a character in different poses can give you an idea of how tall
      the character is, how to draw features properly, and what they look like
      from different angles! A hairstyle or a shirt from the back can be
      extremely different from the front.
    </p>

    <h4>Emotions</h4>
    <p>
      Emotions are very complicated, especially in people. Though is it the same
      case for your imaginary characters? Well, the answer is obviously yes,
      though let's talk more into <b>Why?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Emotions are especially difficult to place into characters due to needing
      experience. To make a character act this way, or change themselves because
      of something they've gone through is difficult due to you not actually
      experiencing what they have gone through or will go through. The easiest
      way to allow your character to express themselves, however, is doing
      research. How real humans and people have reacted to this, what they did
      to cope, etc...
