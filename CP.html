    <h1>Character Development</h1>

    <h4>Experience</h4>
    <p>
      Character Development, ESPECIALLY if your making a character in a game or
      TV show, is extremely important for both viewers to see how characters
      have changed, and for the experiences your character has gone through. A
      few examples are: South Park, God of War, Adventure time, etc... Many of
      these characters are developed by experiences, episodes, the continuation
      of the game or something else! Your character is most likely to have an
      entire change due to development. Whether it be from trauma, learning,
      growing/maturing or others!
    </p>
    <h4>Types of Character Development and experiences</h4>

    <p>
      Of course, not all experiences and developments are the same! We'll be
      talking about different types of experiences here.
    </p>

    <h3>Traumatic</h3>

    <p>
      A traumatic experience is likely to alter your character's personality,
      and or view of the world, and it will most likely have a forever-lasting
      effect on them. Causing development. Character trauma, similar to actual
      trauma, can be based off of anything! Like your character slipping on a
      puddle and embarrassing themselves, being nearly ran over by a car, or
      accidentally almost drowning!
    </p>

    <h3>Maturity</h3>

    <p>
      Maturing is something often depicted in characters in cartoons or art.
      Many characters 'grow up' by having a simple change of voice or
      appearance. Growing taller, bigger, etc... Though sometimes Maturity is
      often shown in personality instead. Maturity can also be shown through
      puberty.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning</h3>

    <p>
      A character can develop from a new journey or experience/lesson. Even from
      your character's daily life, they can still learn and develop! Just like
      people, characters also have their own life and lifestyle. Everyday, like
      people, they go outside of their home on an adventure, to work, to school,
      etc... And learn something new from a first-time experience of something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some characters can face development in different ways, even other than
      this! Though we won't be exploring that today, as this first website would
      be WAYYYYYYY too long.
